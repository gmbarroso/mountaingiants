## The Mountain Giants website
This project was made to promote a theater play called _"The mountain giants"_ from Luigi Pirandello.
It was made in React with no CSS lib, using flex tricks.

### Dependencies
```
  "dependencies": {
    "leaflet": "^1.4.0",
    "ramda": "^0.26.1",
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6",
    "react-leaflet": "^2.2.1",
    "react-redux": "^7.0.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.8"
  },
```

The `Leaflet` dependencies are there because I made some tests and in the future I will apply a map component for the location of the play.

### To build
You can use `npm` or `yarn`:
 - `git clone` in master repo
 - `yarn` or `yarn install` to get all dependencies
 - `yarn start` to run in local

Feel free to contribute :)
